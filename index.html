      <p>At the start of the game, Professor Oak gives the player the choice of 3 different Pokemon. Here, we'll review your choices!</p>

      <h2>Bulbasaur</h2>
      <h3>Physiology</h3>
      <p>
        Bulbasaur resembles a small amphibian/frog, but it bears three claws on
        each of its feet and has no tail. It also has large, red eyes and small,
        sharp teeth. Its skin is a light, turquoise color with dark, green
        spots. It has three claws on all four of its legs. Its most notable
        feature, however, is the aforementioned bulb on its back, which
        according to its entry in the Pokédex, was <em>planted there at birth</em>. It
        also seems that it uses vines that grow out of its back as weapons, they
        are easily extractable.
      </p>
      <h3>Evolution</h3>
      <p>
        Bulbasaur evolves into Ivysaur starting at level 16, and into Venusaur
        at level 32.

      <h2>Charmander</h2>
      <h3>Physiology</h3>
      <p>
        Charmander is a bipedal, reptilian Pokémon with a primarily orange body
        and blue eyes. Its underside from the chest down and the soles of its
        feet are cream-colored. It has two small fangs visible in its upper jaw
        and two smaller fangs in its lower jaw. A fire burns at the tip of this
        Pokémon's slender tail and has blazed there since Charmander's birth.
        <em>The flame can be used as an indication of Charmander's health and mood</em>,
        burning brightly when the Pokémon is strong, weakly when it is
        exhausted, wavering when it is happy, and blazing when it is enraged. It
        is said that Charmander dies if its flame goes out. However, if the
        Pokémon is healthy, the flame will continue to burn even if it gets a
        bit wet and is said to steam in the rain.
      </p>
      <h3>Evolution</h3>
      <p>
        Charmander evolves into Charmeleon starting at level 16, which evolves
        into Charizard starting at level 36.
      </p>

      <h2>Squirtle</h2>
      <h3>Physiology</h3>
      <p>
        Squirtle is a small, light-blue Pokémon with an appearance similar to a
        turtle. With its <strong>aerodynamic</strong> shape and grooved surface, Squirtle's shell
        helps it wade through the water very quickly. It also offers protection
        in battle. Like turtles, Squirtle has a shell that covers its body with
        holes that allow its limbs, tail, and head to be exposed. Unlike a
        turtle, Squirtle is ordinarily bipedal.
      </p>
      <h3>Evolution</h3>
      <p>
        Squirtle evolves into <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Wartortle_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Wartortle</a> starting at level 16, which evolves into
        <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Blastoise_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">Blastoise</a> at level 36.
